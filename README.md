💻 About me  

I’m Killian, a student and passionate developer, currently studying computer science.  
What drives me? Using technology to create, learn, and make ideas come to life 🚀  

I enjoy working on all kinds of projects — from building websites 🌐 and servers 🖥️ to experimenting with design 🎨, UI/UX 📱, creating softwares ⚙️, and even developing game plugins 🎮. I’m curious by nature and love exploring both Back-End 🔧 and Front-End 🌟 development. Lately, I’ve also been intrigued by the field of Artificial Intelligence 🤖 — a new and exciting area that sparks my curiosity and motivates me to learn more every day.🔥

What excites me the most is the feeling of building something useful that can really help people 🤝. Every project is an opportunity to improve my skills 📚 and discover something new ✨.  

Whether it’s a concrete idea 💡 or just a spark of inspiration 🔥, I’d be happy to collaborate and bring it to life. Let’s build something awesome together! 🚀
